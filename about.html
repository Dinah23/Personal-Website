        <p>I love to Travel. I have had the privilege of traveling to many places. If I had to pick just two, it would be the last two trips I took 
          Amelia Island and Vancouver, BC. My Mom was diagnosed with Cancer a few years ago. We weren't sure if she would make it.Her favourite place 
          is the beach. I also love the beach. There is something very healing about listening to the ocean and having the sun on your face. With each
          crashing wave your stress melts away. We enjoyed eating fresh seafood and making memories with my Mom. I am really glad I was able to give her
          that experience and share it with my Sister and my Son. My Son absolutely hated eaverything about the beach. It is funny thinking back on it now.
          My Mom is still with us and we are still making memories.
          In 2019 I traveled to Canada for the first time for the LTX Expo by Linus Tech Tips. I was able to tour the studio and talk to Linus 
          and meet many of my favourite tech tubers. I can't wait to go back this year in July. Vancouver is a magical place. If you haven't been to Canada
          it is a must! Everyone is super nice and respectful. The atmosphere is just different up there. You have the mountains touching the oceans.
          While we were there we went on a lot of tours when we weren't at the convention. I can't wait to see everyone.I have made a lot of friends
          by being in the LTT community fourm and Discord. It will be great to see them in person again.

        <h2>Streaming CSGO and Podcasting</h2>
        <img class="fit-picture"

             alt="Several screenshots from my streams">
        <p>I started streaming on Twitch in 2019. I used to play CSGO every day with friends and one of them streamed and got me interested in streaming
          It was some of the best times of my life. During the pandemic it was an escape and the extra money I earned helped out a lot. I don't streamed anymore but I have been making content on YouTube and 
          I am thinking about streaming again. I really miss it. I love creating content and hosting podcasts about mental health. The community online
          is great and it makes me feel like I am making a small difference.</p>
